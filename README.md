# AskMe.pdf 
The code and the implementation of the Dynamic Memory Networks is based on this paper.

# fetch_babi_data.sh
The data that is used for this model is facebook bAbI dataset. This script could be used to download the data.
Alternatively, the data can be found here - https://research.facebook.com/research/babi/ . This dataset contains data for 20 diffferent tasks and also contains datasets in other languages.

# src
The src folder contain a python notebook called DMN_optimal.ipynb. This file contains all the code that has been used to build and run DMN.
I have experimented with a few hyper parameters and ran the model with the optimal hyperparamters for all the 20 tasks. I have also used these parameters with other languages. You can experiment with different hyperparameters for different tasks.
